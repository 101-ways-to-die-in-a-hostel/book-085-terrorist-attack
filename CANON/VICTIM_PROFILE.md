**Core Flaw:** Frugality

**How it manifests:**
- Obsessively compares prices before any purchase
- Chooses the cheaper option even when the difference is negligible

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Practical - becomes obsessive penny-pinching
2. Humble - becomes inability to treat himself to anything nice

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Cannot stop calculating value - changes plans over minor savings
2. Suspicious of "tourist prices" - trusts cheaper options blindly

### Pet Peeves
- Overpriced tourist traps (ironic: the tourist trap was the safe option)
- Waste of any kind

### Fears
- Surface fear: Running out of money
- Deeper fear: Never being able to afford the life he dreams of

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up in industrial Silesia after the factories closed. Family struggled. Learned to stretch every zloty. Worked as a bus driver for 12 years, saving meticulously for this one trip - his first time leaving Poland.

### Why They Travel
This was his dream trip - finally seeing the cities he'd only seen in pictures. Saved for 6 years. Planned every detail to maximize value. A once-in-a-lifetime adventure.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
It had the best price-to-review ratio on Hostelworld. He'd compared seventeen options in a spreadsheet.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "fair price," "reasonable," "waste," "value"
- Avoids words like: "splurge," "treat yourself," "worth it"
- Catchphrases: "At home this would cost..." / "But is it really worth..."

### Speech Pattern
- Direct and unpretentious
- Strong Polish accent in English
- Speaks slowly to be understood

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant price comparison. Mental currency conversion. Running budget calculations. Occasional wonder that he's actually here.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** None - prefers privacy
- **Follower count:** N/A
- **Posting style:** N/A
- **Last post before death:** Email to his mother with photos attached

### Online vs Reality
What you see is what you get. One of the few genuine people in hostels. His online absence is authentic - he wants to experience things, not document them.

## Relationships

### Family
- Elderly mother he calls daily
- Sister and her kids he adores (brought them presents from every city)

### Friends
- Fellow bus drivers he plays cards with on Sundays
- Hostel acquaintances who like his straightforward manner

### Romantic

### At the Hostel
- Popular for being genuinely helpful without expecting anything
- Shares budget tips freely
- Cooks in the hostel kitchen to save money (good cook)

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Has a great day sightseeing. Excited about his dinner reservation at the famous tourist restaurant. Checks prices one more time.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Sitting at the "cheaper" restaurant, thinking with satisfaction about the 20 euros he saved. The food is good. He's content.

### Final Thoughts
None - the blast is instantaneous. His last conscious thought was about how good the bread was.

### Last Words
"Przepraszam, can I have more bread?" (to the waiter, moments before)
